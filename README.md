# BattleShip

A 2-player guessing game where each player arranges his fleet of ships on a grid, locations of which are
concealed from the opponent. 
The players alternate turns taking shot at the opponent’s fleet and the one who
destroys the opponent’s fleet first wins.
Implemented using the MVC software design pattern where 2 LAN connected client PCs communicate with
the server PC using RMI.
